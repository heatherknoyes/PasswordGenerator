# PasswordGenerator

## Description

// edit here
The motivation for this project was to learn how to read through an existing code base, and to make changes to make it more readable without affecting the overall functionality and look of the website. In this project I refactored an existing code base of the HTML code to have more semantic elements and to be more accessible. In addition, I also refactored the CSS code base to reflect the changes that were done in the HTML code, reordered elements to be in a semantic structure, and consolidated pieces of code for a more streamlined code base. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user acceptance criteria.

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

This project taught me how I can expect to potentially see websites as they come through in the real world and be able to edit the code base to bring it up to the standards of today. This is extremely important for accessibility standards as well as time to market for future edits if the website were to be worked on.

## Installation

1. Download all files within the main directory as well as the assets directory to your device.

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the website.

3. If future edits need to be made then the stylesheet can be found under ./assets/css/style.css. The javascript can be found under the parent folder.

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance in three different screenshots:
